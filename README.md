## :mag: Methodology
Began with the official NBA website to identify key metrics and moved to other statistical websites for detailed data, including basketball-reference, real-gm, wikipedia, etc. Retrieved team and player historical data, splitting into two seperate tables for the visualization. The data was then processed and cleaned in Excel and visualized using Tableau.
